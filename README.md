# Outstrikell

A text-based solver for Strikeout puzzles, written in Haskell as a project for Function-Oriented Programming class at WUT
Compilation: `ghc Main.hs`
Execution: `./Main <path to file containing the puzzle>`
**Do not** change the name of the executable file -- `.gitignore` can't deal with it!
